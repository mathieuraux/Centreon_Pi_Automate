# Centreon_Pi_Automate
Auto install of centreon (central) on a Raspberry pi 3 (with CentOS for Pi)

First, please find CentOs for Raspberry Pi here :

http://isoredirect.centos.org/altarch/7/isos/armhfp/

Then, write it with etcher and launch your raspberry. In the very first time, you need to use the following command to extend your root partition :

```
rootfs-expand
```

Reboot your device after that. Give it an ip address and a hostname.
